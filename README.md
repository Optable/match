The sender (often a publisher) and the receiver (often an advertiser) each have a target user audience list. Additionally, the Advertiser holds a numerical (or binary) feature associated with each user in its audience list. 

The sender wants to know the number of users they have in common and the receiver, the aggregate (i.e., sum) of the feature for the common users without revealing any other information about the respective audience lists.
