A public set intersection algorithms library, written in go, for the adtech industry.

# dhpsi

The Publisher and the Advertiser perform a Private Set Intersection (PSI) of the audience lists, where only the Publisher learns the intersection before serving the ad. 

After serving the ad, the Publisher can share the (i) impression and all user identifiers (in the intersection); (ii) analytics (aggregates); or (iii) impression and a list of all user identifiers (for whom at least one ad was served over a period of time) with the Advertiser.

We focus on the Private Set Intersection (PSI) of the Publisher’s and the Advertiser’s audience list for now.
